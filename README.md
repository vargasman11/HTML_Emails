#### Amazon_Eblasts, Conversion_Interactive, and Hornady Transportation
 These emails were created for Driver Recruiting Campaigns. Both email campaigns use MJML 
 (Mailjet Markup Language) to output consistent Cross-Client-Compatibility. Once inside a project run 
```text
npm i && npm run mjml
```
To install dependencies and start watching files.

#### Walmart_Eblasts
These emails were written in plain HTML. Each individual project had their asset url modified to point 
to the "images" directory so the assets would appear in a local environment.
